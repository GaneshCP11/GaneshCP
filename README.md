FM Circuit

AIM :- To build an FM Transmitter circuit which can transmit signals upto a range of 2 km

WORKING
The audio signal from the microphone is a very low level signal, of the order of millivolts. This extremely small voltage needs to be first amplified by a bipolar transistor which produces an amplified inverted signal.
When the LC oscillator in the circuit is given a voltage input, the output signal is a mixture of the input signal and the oscillating output signal, producing a modulated signal.  In other words, the frequency of the oscillator generated circuit varies with the application of an input signal, producing a frequency modulated signal.
